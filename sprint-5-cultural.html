                  I rush alot, i dont take as much time as i need to understand

                  i work best with a time constrained schedule. if i have no

                  Im not as honest with myself as i thought i was. I thought i
                  knew my body, how i felt, what i wanted, how i wanted to live.
                  but i never dove deep enough into my thoughts and feelings,
                  until i started journaling. im slowly figuring out what i want
                  and what kind of life i want to live. im very gratefull to eda
                  for this realisation.

                <h3 class="title is-3 center">Why so much time on core?</h3>
                <div class="tile box is-child">
                  Because these skills will be very beneficial for finding a
                  job, especially a programming one.

                <div class="tile box is-child">
                  i think the person who wrote the core material had alot of
                  experiences in their life that helped them learn the
                  principles they would later add to the core material. because
                  they want to help people progress, especially like minded
                  'coding' people

                  What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
                </p>
                <p>
                  how timely and readily applicable the content was. I have been
                  conscious of most of the core material but I never put in the
                  time and effort to fully understand the concepts and
                  principles. After doing the core work i have been applying
                  these concepts in my life with great benefits!

                  Is core wasted time?
                </p>
                <p>
                  "time spent learning core, is time well spent". learning and
                  applying principles like growth mindset and mindfullness are
                  so beneficial for anyone that wants to grow and become the
                  best version of themselves. Personally applying these
                  principles has drastically shapes how i live my life. i
                  dedicate more time for me, to really be concious of how im
                  feeling, and to relfect on the day. and acknowledging that i
                  am capable of only this right now, while knowing i grow really
                  empowers me and helps me to enjoy the process of progression!
