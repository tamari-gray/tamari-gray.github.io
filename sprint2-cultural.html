                      i dont know exactly what im gonna end up doing. but i know the dicipline, technical and personal skills i will gain from completing this course will open a world of oppurtunities. i do want to be a creative director of my own company one day. just making apps or creative solutions to benefit and connect everyone. but thats more like 10 years away.</p>

                          Ive spent the last 5 years dreaming about where i want to be but not having the dicipline to get me there. I always make plans while not usually seeing them through, but with my passion to learn and progress and the support from eda i know i can get where i want to be!

                      <li>
                          <span class="subtitle">Confidence</span><br>
                           I want to be confident in my technical ability that i can do contract work, turn my ideas into real tangible applications, and beable to have fun with coding.

                      <li>
                          <span class="subtitle">Teamwork</span><br>
                          Ive never worked within a really functional team before, in class especially the work always gets pushed onto the more responsible people. Im looking forward to learning what it takes to be apart of a productive team.

                          <span class="subtitle">Project management</span><br>
                           Ive failed alot at managing projects and finding the right balance between work/life. Ive used all the cool ne tools to help me but didnt have the dicipline to back up my plan.This course feels like its going to get full on soon and i definitely need to develop this skill!

                  <p class="title">Strengths & limitations</p>
                  <div>
                      My biggest strength is that ive taken a course and failed because my heart wasnt in it. Ive tried to learn to code on my own for 2 years now and i have the opportunity to get closer to my developer goal. i wont take it for granted and will try my best because i want to get as much out of this as i can.</div>
                  <div>
                    My biggest weakness is lack of dicipline. its hard to forego temporary pleasures in sight of something greater. and its very hard to stay consistent at anything. eda looks like it has a great support system and im looking forward to working with everyone and developing this skill with them. </div>

                  <p class="title">Challenges</p>
                  <div>my biggest non technical challenge will be to ask for help. bootcamp looks intense, and if im not staying up to date with everything i could get overwhelmed easily from it. asking for help from anyone has always been diddicult for me because i feel like its a big burden on them. and i dont want to burden anyone. but again, the support from eds looks great and its comforting to know that its there should i need it.</div></article>
