                    <p class="title"> limitations </p>
              <p>my only limitation is not having the finances to set myself up to find a job in auckland or wellington straight away.


                  An experience of working productively with others and there was tension was when me and my flatmates were trying to find people to replace us for our rooms so we can break the lease and move away.  I used the strategy of doing whatever i could to help and start early, and hope the others will see my determination and start doing the same. my strategy was not effective at all. Rather then trying to help everyone get people for their rooms at the same time and get overwhelmed, i should have methodically went through. made sure mine was done, then helped the next person, then the next. Its much less stressful doing it this way and its always easier to do things one step at a time.</p>

                    <p>
                        my culture is very family and love oriented. praise is given for showing respect for elders and tradition.
                        everyone is proud to be Maori and to be in our family. 
                        These cultural values have heavily influenced mine whether i like it or not. Ive had alot of trouble being able to stand up for myself in the workplace as ive had respect and go out of your way for your superiors drilled into me. Fortunately ive acknowledged and processed this, discovering how low i put myself in my priority list.

              <p>
                  im experienced in building a web-application from scratch.


                  My strengths are that once im hooked, ive got lazer focus and can get lost in my work for days. Ive failed so much at committing to projects, reaching my goals. That i know how to utilize my potential.  Having a flexible daily routine that encourages discipline and does not discourage rest/ fun time. Using chunking methodology to tackle projects and goals. And above everything, enjoy the moment. 
                  
                  
                  This will definitely help me in my learning journey. when im stuck into something, its really easy to get lost in enjoying the process. This will keep my fire lit so i can power through the work!!
