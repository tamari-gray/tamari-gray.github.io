                          Ive spent the last 5 years dreaming about where i want to be but not having the dicipline to get me there. I always make plans while not usually seeing them through, but with my passion to learn and progress and the support from eda i know i can get where i want to be!

                      <li>
                          <span class="subtitle">Confidence</span><br>
                           I want to be confident in my technical ability that i can do contract work, turn my ideas into real tangible applications, and beable to have fun with coding. 
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <span class="subtitle">Teamwork</span><br>
                          Ive never worked within a really functional team before, in class especially the work always gets pushed onto the more responsible people. Im looking forward to learning what it takes to be apart of a productive team.

                      <li>
                          <span class="subtitle">Project management</span><br>
                           Ive failed alot at managing projects and finding the right balance between work/life. Ive used all the cool ne tools to help me but didnt have the dicipline to back up my plan.This course feels like its going to get full on soon and i definitely need to develop this skill!

                  <p class="title">Strengths & limitations</p>
                  <div>
                      <p class="subtitle">strengths are:</p>
                      * failure, ive failed and learnt so much from trying to achieve my goals. I know that im not going to get anywhere if i take the easy path, and the long term treats of the mahi im doing now are going to be so worth it.
                      * clarity. i know exactly what i want out of this course, and that makes it alot easier to stay passionate and try my best.
                      * self directed learning. Ive taught myself many things from photoshop, premiere pro to fl studio and abelton, the piano, vue/nuxt js. Im very confident i can continue the dicipline rewuired to learn these in this course.
                  </div>
                  <div>
                      <p class="subtitile"> weakneses are:</p>
                      * confidence
                      * dicipline
                      * project management
                      * selflessness
                      * self doubt. It always creeps in every opportunity it gets. Whenever i hit a hurdle or i break, its hard not to doubt yourself. i hope in completing this course, a big milestone for me, i can gain alot of confidence in my self and minimise my self doubt.
