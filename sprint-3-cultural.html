                    <p>
                      emotional intelligence is the ability to know whats going on in your body and surroundings. to conciously        realise whats out of place, whats working for you, and what you can practice to better control over how you process and express your emotions.

                    <p>
                        IQ indicates your intelligence level. you get tested on your ability to learn and apply information, do logical thinking. EQ is how you can assess and control your emotions.

                        knowing how you are really feeling guides you on what decisions to make. when to give your body a rest, or when you need to dig deeper. Being aware of what emotions you are pushing down makes it clear on what you need to process, before your thoughts and judgement get clouded by it.

                        being able to tackle any challenge with a calm clear mind is a golden skill. valuable in any workplace but more importantly your life. With all the many challenges everyone faces in their daily lives, the time and stress saved from dealing with problems in a calm matter will have significant benifits.

                        if you want to strive to be a big problem solver and help others, you need to be in a position to do so. I can imagine elon musk has great emotional intelligence as he can perform at his optimum state handling failure, family and running an incredible company. </p>
