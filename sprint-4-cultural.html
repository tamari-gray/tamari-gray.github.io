                <p> practise x 10000. apply new information in a relatable context. Imagination can be just as good as physical action when learning something.
                    for skateboarding i will try visualising more, trying the trick in different ways/ on different obstacles, and analysing it with a different perspective.</p>

                <p class="title center">what it is and relevance</p>
                <p>having a growth mindset is believing that you can grow and progress through practice and hard work. that you aren't limited to natural skills. Its very relevant because if we believed that we can only do 5 push ups then we wont feel empowered to try harder and grow!Thinking that some people are smart and some people are naturally talented is a bit disheartening, especially when these types of people are better then you at something. But knowing that your capable of achieving  through hard work and repetition is very empowering. And encourages a desire to grow. </p>

                <p> yes. I realised ive had a fixed mindset for the past 2 years. This showed through all aspects of my life, i thought i was just a messy person so i didnt clean my room, i thought i was only good at this type of skating so i didnt progress much and i thought that wouldnt progress, which made it very hard to do so!</p>

                <p>
                    realising that being where i am right now is fine. and practicing that im not there YET. i just need more practice. and practice i shall!

              <div class="is-child box tile is-6">
                <p> I will stop getting caught up in "where i should be". but rather acknowledge where i am right now. ive changed my learning plan slightly by mapping out what i want to do and breaking the pathways to get to those goals into habits. alotting a specific amount of pomodoros per week for each habit. e.g ive got 3 pomos for language study, and 9 for gym that i can flexibly spread across the week. This ensures that im consistently practising and strengthening those neuro pathways! </p>
